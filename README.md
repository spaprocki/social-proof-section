- [Modern Fluid Typography Using CSS Clamp](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/01/modern-fluid-typography-css-clamp/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally implement CSS Clamp for fluid change of font-size between screen sizes, while mixing rem and vw to express font-size. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
